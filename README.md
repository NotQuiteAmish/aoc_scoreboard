This is a program to parse the JSON given by the Advent of Code API for local leaderboards.

To run, first gather your session cookie and the link to the json file for your local leaderboard.

Change the name of `config.py-example` to `config.py`, and fill in the appropriate data that was collected.

The program can then be run using `python leaderboard.py > output.txt`
